# Give-Me-a-Sec_TITAN
“Give Me a Sec” reimagines critical thinking as a temporal, embodied, and intentional process. Across eight pixel-art interactive experiences, users confront disinformation, uncover TITAN—a Socratic AI guide—and engage in multimodal reflection. The project frames truth-seeking as active participation in the digital age.
