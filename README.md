# Just Give Me a Minute to Think Critically_TITAN
“Just Give Me a Minute to Think Critically” reinscribes critical thinking as temporal, embodied, and intentional. This is an interactive, web-based experience that puts users against the forces of disinformation to discover the existent TITAN—a Socratic AI guide—and go into multimodal reflection. Through friction, gesture, and inquiry, this project frames critical thinking as active participation in the digital age.

“Just Give me a Minute to Think Critically” is structured as a precisely designed experiential flow, with each interactive piece unfolding over approximately one minute. This temporal pacing mirrors TITAN’s philosophical mission: to slow down cognition, invite reflection, and resist reactive consumption of information. Across six interactive modules, users are progressively guided through a narrowing conceptual path—from foundational learning models to moments of friction and disorientation, and ultimately toward embodied self-recognition. Each step builds upon the last, subtly shifting the user from passive observer to active participant, and finally, to intentional thinker. TITAN is not merely a tool—it is a structured conversation, a mirror held up to the mind, and a co-participant in the pursuit of clarity.
